ARGEOM - Augmented Reality Geolocation Math

Augmented reality combined with modern day smartphones equipped with cameras, magnetometers, and with the ability to display maps on the screen make a powerful tool that can be used in a plethora of different applications. This project is the reference implementation mentioned in the paper I wrote about building such apps. The paper explores the math that goes behind such apps and the implementation of a completely functional project.
